# Education

I began studying engineering at the University of Queensland in 2018. I chose UQ for its large campus, resources, and its vicinity to colleges which I lived in for my first year.

## Year 1 - 2018
I began my first year undeclared in a major, but was my interested in electrical engineering. So I enrolled in courses which covered many topics, which were:
- ENGG1100 - Engineering Design
- ENGG1200 - Engineering Modelling & Probelm Solving
- ENGG1300 - Introduction to Electrical Systems
- ENGG1400 - Engineering Mechanics, Statics & Dynamics
- CSSE1001 - Introduction to Software Engineering
- PHYS1002 - Electromagnetism & Modern Physics
- MATH1051 - Calculus & Linear Algebra 1
- MATH1052 - Multivariate Calculus & Ordinary Differential Equations

## Year 2 - 2019
In my second year I declared my major as Mechatronic Engineering. I was interested in robotics, automation, and studying the core topics of electrical, mechanical, and software engineering. I followed the recommmended course load and order. However, I struggled to find motivation to complete assessment and suffered the consequences. 
- METR2800 - Mechatronic System Design Project 1
- MECH2300 - Structures & Materials
- MECH2210 - Intermediate Mechanical & Space Dynamics
- ELEC2004 - Circuits, Signals, & Systems
- CSSE2010 - Introduction to Computer Systems
- MATH2001 - Advance Calculus & Linear Algebra 2
- MATH2010 - Analysis of Ordinary Differential Equations
- STAT2202 - Probability Models for Engineering & Science
- PHYS1002 - Electromagnetism & Modern Physics

## Year 3 - 2020
The year begun as normal, but quickly turned into a year like no other. The COVID pandemic forced us into external learning. I failed four courses my first semester in 2019, so half the year was a repeat.
- MECH2300 - Structures & Materials
- MECH2210 - Intermediate Mechanical & Space Dynamics
- MECH2100 - Machine Element Design
- ELEC2003 - Electromechanics & Electronics
- CSSE2010 - Introduction to Computer Systems
- CSSE2002 - Programming in the Large
- MATH2001 - Advance Calculus & Linear Algebra 2

## Year 4 - 2021
- METR3100 - Control System Implementation
- METR4201 - Control Engineering 1
- METR4202 - Robotics & Automation
- MECH3200 - Advanced Dynamics & Vibration
- ELEC3004 - Signals, Systems, & Control
- CSSE2002 - Programming in the Large

## Year 5 - 2022
- ENGG4900 - Professional Practice & the Business Environment
- METR4810 - Mechatronic System Design Project 2
- ELEC3004 - Signals, Systems, & Control
- COMP3506 - Data Structures & Algorithms
- COMP3702 - Artificial Intelligence

## Year 6 - 2023
- METR4911 - Thesis Design/Research Project
- MECH2410 - Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics
- MECH3410 - Fluid Mechanics
- ELEC4630 - Image Processing and Computer Vision
