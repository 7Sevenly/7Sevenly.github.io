# ABOUT

## WHO AM I?
My name is John Hanna. I was born in Canterbury NZ, spent my early years on Guam US (a small island in the pacific), attended school on the Sunshine Coast AUS, and am currently completing a degree at the University of Queensland, Brisbane AUS. My interests include Rugby Union, Formula 1, pool, and robotics. I'm an avid supporter of sustainable living:
* Energy - Solar, Hydro, Nuclear
* Travel - Trains, Buses, Walking
* Food - Vegetarian, Locally sourced

## WHAT DO I DO?
I'm in my final year studying a Bachelor of Mechatronic Engineering, at the University of Queensland. 
I've worked many jobs, but the major ones were as an undergaduate engineer for Smithbridge Group, a rigger for Universal Cranes Sunshine Coast, and as an undergraduate signalling engineer for Rail Control Systems Australia.

## WHAT IS THIS FOR?
I want to document my day-to-day life as an engineer. This includes my studies, career advancement, projects, and perspective of the world.
The goal is to create a place where I, or other interested parties, can look back to and get a sense of who I am and what I've achieved.
