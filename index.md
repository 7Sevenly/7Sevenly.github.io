# Welcome
Hi, my name is John and welcome to a blog about my life as an engineer. I've been on the path towards becoming an engineer since I was 15 years old (2014).
It started with my interests in nuclear energy and robotics. I excelled in mathematics, physics, and graphics, got an OP 1 and was accepted to the University of Queensland's Engineering Program.
