# What is Deep learning?

Deep learning is a machine learning technique that trains computers to perform tasks which humans find natural or intuitive. 
Standard systems use neural network architecture, which creates an adaptive system of layered nodes, essentially mimicing the nuerons of a human brain.

This technique is called *deep* learning because they have far more hidden layers than traditional neural networks.

Some examples where deep learning is used heavily are:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Voice Recognition
- Computer Vision
- Self-driving Vehicles
- Image Generation
- Medical Diagnostics
- Biological Analysis
- Internet Searching
- Robotics
- Playing games
