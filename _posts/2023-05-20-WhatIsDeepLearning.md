# What is Deep learning?

Deep learning is a machine learning technique that trains computers to perform tasks which humans find natural or intuitive.
This technique is called *deep* learning because of the increase in hidden layers compared to traditional neural networks.

Neural network architecture creates an adaptive system of layered nodes, mimicing the neurons of a human brain.

Some examples where deep learning is used heavily are:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Voice Recognition
- Computer Vision
- Self-driving Vehicles
- Image Generation
- Medical Diagnostics
- Biological Analysis
- Internet Searching
- Robotics
- Playing games
