# Using AI to Write AI

I've learnt how to create and train a model following the fastai module "00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data". 
However, it doesn't address the next step of testing the model on an assortment of images, only one. I've realised I'm going 
to need more than one set of images; a training and validation set, and a testing set. So I've decided to split my existing 
folder of animals into two folders, "training' and "testing".

I'm no master coder though so I'm consulting ChatGPT to find a method of copying my orginal folder, and moving a suitable 
number of images into the predescribed folders. I asked ChatGPT to "write python code that leaves 120 images in the folder and 
moves the remaining to another folder." It's response is shown below.

With a few modifications to the folder creation, and some checks to determine the number of images to move, the method worked 
seemlessly. This was a great example of how AI and deep learning can be a tool for all, when the barriers to access it are removed.
